Troubleshooting involves asking questions, like an inverter doctor, in order to diagnose the root-cause and fix it, and referring to experience with previous similar situations or our knowledge bank to fix the issue. It might have no display, or it may have a red fault light with a fault code. If it is the latter, I find out what the fault code is. A couple of fault codes indicate that there is a fault with the inverter. Other fault codes could have multiple causes, so diagnosis is required. For instance, fault 010 indicates that there is no connection to the grid. This could be remedied by restarting the inverter; checking whether the circuit breaker is tripping off, and when in relation to inverter operation (e.g. after startup, randomly, or in the middle of the day); and testing the inverter by measuring the voltage internally across the AC terminal.
