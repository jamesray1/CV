### Incentivizing Waste Reduction
Founder, Feb 2019 to March 2019

This was a brief period looking into weight-based pricing for waste. Gaining traction with the proposal would involve a council trialing it, which requires political will. See [this petition](https://secure.avaaz.org/en/community_petitions/Local_councils_worldwide_Provide_more_bin_sizes_and_sort_more_waste_to_reduce_waste_to_landfill/) for providing multiple bin sizes with different rates, and [this petition: Weigh residual and organic wastes, charge by weight, and add multiple recyclable streams](https://secure.avaaz.org/en/community_petitions/Local_councils_Incentivize_waste_reduction_by_weighing_general_waste_and_charging_for_the_weight/).

### Solar Engineer at Solar Energy Enterprises

Two days a week from 12 July 2017—29 August 2017 doing residential and solar solar project management, which included roof feasibility studies for solar installation, and grid applications. I finished the work by my choice because I wanted to focus more time on Ethereum, and could've been working full-time at Sungrow if I had wanted to (which I didn't). 

### Independent researcher on the sustainable energy industry

2011–2016 (this includes a Bachelor of Engineering in Renewable energy from 2011–14).

### Project/Engineering Assistant at Todae Solar

Nov 2015

This was a feasibility study or pre-design. Solar sytem pre-design, feasibility studies, Nearmap, project management, spreadsheets. More information is available [here](project-assistant-todate-solar.md).

### Product Development Manager at Solar Energy Enterprises

I worked about 4 hours a week for several weeks in mid-2015 as a product development manager. See [here](product-development-manager-SEE.md) FMI.

I also provided sales assistance and technical support at an expo and as a door-to-door lead generator doorknocker in late 2014 / early 2015.

### Village Infrastructure

This was more of a project that took about a few days work in around late 2015. I was a consultant pitching for funds for a contest for solar agroprocessing in developing countries.
