<p>This page has research on sustainable innovation from the idea stage of the technology life cycle through to commercial maturity, with technological measures also including policy and behavioural changes. Note that technology can be defined as a combination of people, artefacts (anything created, modified or used by people, which also includes institutions, organisations and policies) and knowledge. I do this research to find areas that I would be most interested in contributing my time, energy and money to in order to maximise positive impact; as well as sharing findings with others. It's a compendium of innovation that I've put together over the years.</p>

Following is an attempted summary of some of the different kinds of innovations needed:

- Demand-side improvements: energy conservation, efficiency, demand-side response management (e.g. electric vehicle charging and using smart metering, software and IoT to programmably turn appliances off if the price of electricity [using spot pricing, network cost-reflective pricing, peak-demand pricing, location- and capacity-based pricing, etc.] that they are charged [rather than a flat rate] rises above x c/kWh) monitoring, control of appliances, IoT, more sustainable buildings (existing and new) and life cycle, cradle-to-cradle, regenerative treatment of goods and services;
- Supply-side improvements: [oversupply of renewables](https://theconversation.com/a-radical-idea-to-get-a-high-renewable-electric-grid-build-way-more-solar-and-wind-than-needed-113635) with a mix of solar, wind, and any storage like pumped hydro and batteries to meet gaps in production (which are reduced with oversupply); reducing costs in installation, manufacture, decommissioning, recycling; enabling more mobile and lower cost PV systems, a la [5B](https://5b.com.au/) for ground-mounted systems and [Solpod](https://www.solpod.com.au/) for roof-mounted systems; novel generation technologies, e.g. photovoltaic glass (a la [Ubiquitous Energy](http://ubiquitous.energy/)), [Vortex Bladeless](https://vortexbladeless.com/), [solar paint](https://understandsolar.com/solar-paint/), solar films, [printed solar](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/research-and-innovation/centre/coe/research/organic-solar-cells), and floating PV;  incremental improvements to existing technologies;
- Grid-improvements: More interconnection of grids over larger areas and with stronger links; virtual power plants/aggregation; peer-to-peer electricity trading
- Finance improvements: [Clean Energy Investment Trusts (CEITs)](http://climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Beyond-YieldCos-1.pdf), ethical investment mutual and superannuation funds (e.g. [Australian Ethical Investment](https://www.australianethical.com.au/) and [Future Super](https://www.myfuturesuper.com.au/)), community renewable energy, PPAs, etc.
- software improvements: software tools such as [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) look more promising and able to achieve a fairer Internet and economy than changes in public policy. Holochain enables [mutual sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3X5_zAUjlw), has a design that is inspired by nature, and is a scalable distributed app framework with data integrity. It enables creation of a new economy, that is much more compatible with the collaborative information age and the world we live in, than current models like capitalism and representative democracy, using mutual and reputational credit, and triple-entry accounting. This will also help to deal with the [massive levels](https://commodity.com/debt-clock/) of [global debt](https://www.economist.com/content/global_debt_clock) and instability caused by an [even larger derivatives market](https://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/). In addition to [holochain.org](https://holochain.org), more information about Holochain is also available via [holo.host/learn](https://holo.host/learn/) and [this excellent video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3X5_zAUjlw). Holochain apps (happs) each run on their own network using Holochain as a framework, rather than having one massive global ledger like Ethereum or Bitcoin. [Redgrid](https://redgrid.io/) is one such happ that is a platform that aims to provide an Internet of energy, by building other happs on top of it, such as for demand response managment with IoT, monitoring and control; peer-to-peer electricity trading (or trading of other commodities like environmental certificates); community renewable energy; and tracking and rewarding the production of renewable energy assests (as [Swytch](https://swytch.io/) and [Solarcoin](https://solarcoin.org/) aims to do but with a blockchain). Other innovations that would partner well with Holochain, Redgrid and the Internet of Energy include mesh networks (e.g. [Serval](http://www.servalproject.org/)), [broadband over power lines (BOPL)](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/broadbandoverpowerlines.html) (note that it can be over any low or medium voltage power lines, including microgrids and standalone power systems, not just grids), [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/), and decentralised AI (a la [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/)). Other interesting software innovations includes [Open Climate Fix](https://openclimatefix.github.io/) working on solar forecasting, and previously energy disaggregation (to e.g. [recognize appliances from power signatures measured by a single meter](http://jack-kelly.com/open_repository_for_appliance_power_signatures_computer_science)); and optimising energy usage with emergent behaviour. These points aren't included below as each are quite different and hard to summarize without missing info.
- Wealth redistribution: Holochain and the Metacurrency project can help to achieve a more egalitarian society by using mutual credit, and currency designed for abundance and transacting, not scarcity and hoarding. The debit and credit limits can fluctuate with supply and demand, and with reputation and service. The distributed nature of happs make them more suited to democratic power relationships.
- Mobile energy: hydrogen (which could be supplied by electrolysis from excess renewable energy) or batteries, as well as better transport (e.g. high-speed rail or Hyperloop and autonomous vehicles)
- Policies: e.g. renewable energy targets; emissions trading; investment; allowing local electricity trading; mandates e.g. for energy performance disclosure and [construction of solar on new buildings](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/california-approves-plan-to-mandate-solar-panels-on-new-homes.html); continual improvement in energy efficiency ratings (even in just one jurisdiction like California may be enough due to globalisation) and other enabling policies for the above improvements. The [Science Party has some good energy policies](https://www.scienceparty.org.au/energy_policy).
- Reduction in human population until we can be confident that we are living within the carrying capacity of the environment, e.g. until we get to greenhouse gas concentrations of 350 ppm CO2-e, by non-violent means, e.g. celibacy, education, and other means of contraception where celibacy isn't practiced. Otherwise, with irreversible runaway climate change caused by tipping points, constraints placed by physics, biology and economics show that there will be suffering and loss of life through wars over water, food and resources; increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters like heatwaves, floods, tsunamis, cyclones/typhoons/hurricanes, bushfires; and rising sea levels. Unfortunately, those in poorer nations and those closer to the equator are more likely to suffer, especially without sufficient compassionate treatment.
- Other innovations include energy, but can also be broader than it, such as life cycle assessment, carbon trading, and certification in supply chains. The use of scalable cryptographic technologies like Holochain can help to deliver these innovations globally and on a mainstream level, although careful design is needed to make data publicly verifiable through the use of IoT, measuring devices, and distribution of certification agencies or validation, e.g. with webs of trust (which could allow anyone to be validators of measuring devices and data) and sovereign accountable commons (a Holochain ecosystem concept, analogous to decentralised autonomous organisations). A guy called Federico spoke to me last night about his ideas for using LCA and emissions trading with blockchains. I was talking him into using Holochain instead. It would be interesting to see life cycle assessment, trading of greenhouse gas emissions and other mechanisms to conserve the environment with a common property rights approach, used with Holochain. With LCA you could track embodied energy, renewable and non-renewable resource usage and other environmental impact metrics, then use it for a global certification system for goods and services. With emissions trading having a global network with a happ would help to achieve an international market.

<p>There are innumerous entities that are innovating in the sustainable energy sector. Innovation can be defined as a change in technology. Usually, when people talk about innovation they talk about innovations that are useful,&nbsp;positive changes in technology. There are two kinds of innovators: radical innovators and incremental innovators. I will define radical innovations as a major change in a technology, or the use of an enabling technology with an existing one, or a disruptive technology, all causing a major change to reduce the cost of providing the technology service, and enabling new markets, which further drives down costs. Incremental innovations can be defined as learnings that cause smaller reductions in cost, e.g. prototype testing finding flaws to be fixed pre-production, increased manufacturing supply, and user feedback resulting in product development.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outdated paragraph—Holochain is better than Ethereum due to better scalability while having data integrity. Running on top of the public Ethereum blockchain (with a token) is better than using a private blockchain, or worse, not running on a blockchain at all (thus requiring a trusted third party which increases transaction costs). Running on the public Ethereum blockchain is more secure than a private chain, since the public chain is much longer and has many nodes mining and verifying it. A private chain is more prone to different kinds of attacks, particularly a <a href="https://learncryptography.com/cryptocurrency/51-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">51% attack</a>. Having open-source code is important to verify the security and performance of the software, as well as being able to innovate, e.g. with enhancements.</p>

<h2><b>Energy generation</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Energy generation from devices of a few watts for lights and appliances in developing countries (as well as outdoor solar lights in developed countries), to utility scale (defined as more than 100 kW in Australia to transition from small scale renewable energy certificates [RECs] to large scale RECs) is important to increase the affordability of energy and increase environmental sustainability. Household and commercial generators help to reduce consumption from the grid (or in some cases not being connected to the grid), while utility scale helps to reduce the cost of wholesale electricity low through the merit order effect. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy can increase the cost of retail electricity. Energy storage, interconnection, demand side management, decentralised energy trading, energy monitoring, energy efficiency, and energy conservation then become more important to reduce costs for the end user.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://www.raygen.com/">Raygen:</a> utility scale concentrating solar PV with compressed air storage. They claim:<br>
"our task now is to turn RayGen’s world-leading technology into a commercially viable system that can produce electricity at a lower cost than burning fossil fuels. We believe we’re well on the way to achieving this lofty ambition, and to giving humankind its best and most efficient mechanism to harness the power of the sun and to provide cheap and clean energy for all." They don't provide a more detailed economic assessment of cost-benefit calculations to different stakeholders, particularly the customer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you add in the costs after generation of utility scale electricity, from transmission, distribution, retail, then costs add up. If you can bring the point of energy generation closer to the end user, then there is more potential to eliminate or nullify those costs by going off-grid or storing and trading energy, respectively. Utility scale energy has to compete on the wholesale market. Energy generation at the point of use only has to compete with the retail electricity market. (I've calculated the single rate national average at around 28.7 c/kWh ex. GST for FY2014/15 [see <a href="http://www.aemc.gov.au/getattachment/02490709-1a3d-445d-89cd-4d405b246860/2015-Residential-Electricity-Price-Trends-report.aspx">here</a>, p. 80: $1507/5248 kWh = 28.7 c/kWh]. Electricity pricing schemes include: single rate with a c/kWh component; daily fixed charges (usually a component of bills), time of use; electricity generation buyback rates at 6-10 c/kWh, spot-tied electricity pricing, capacity charges, imaginary power charges, charges varying by location, and peak demand charges. There are avoided costs, including for placing generators on the fringe of grids, and for avoiding the construction of peaking gas power plants and the cost of network augmentation.</p>

<p>Solar paint or printed flexible sheets: developed by the <a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/research-and-innovation/centre/coe/about-us">Priority Research Centre for Organic Electronics</a>. The Centre is led by Professor Paul Dastoor, who said at a Innovators Re:volutionising Energy event at NSW Parliament House that he has had two PhD students do economic modelling (quipping that they were "sacrificed on the altar of scientific progress"), with the latest modelling finding that the levelised cost of electricity is about 10 c/kWh. I have asked him for a citation for that finding by email, and am waiting for a reply. This is quite a remarkable result, as the technology is on the cusp of pilot plant demonstration, i.e. it is early in technology learning, and so costs should reduce much more. By comparison, the LCOE in an Australian study in 2006 was $120/MWh, or $0.12/kWh (see <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source">here</a>, the original source is here. Given the global nature of the industry, costs for Australia can be estimated from more recent studies in other countries. The technology still needs to be tested more in pilot plants to find out potential challenges such as degradation rates. Because of the relatively low efficiency of a few percent, this technology would be less suitable for utility scale applications, but would work well for covering opaque building surfaces.</p>

<p>Examples include wearing clothing appropriate for the temperature (e.g. not wearing a jacket in an office when it's warm in summer; wearing layers of warm clothes when it's very cold); natural ventilation; natural lighting (daylighting); shorter (cold) showers; reducing hot water usage; active transport (e.g. walking, cycling, and skating); public transport; motorcycles; and carpooling. Yes, these are all kinds of innovation too! Technology is not just artefacts, but also constitutes of entities, knowledge, and actions that change human lives.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a>, <a href="http://www.gm.com/index.html">GM</a>, <a href="http://www.ford.com.au/">Ford</a>, and other vehicle manufacturers who are either trying to innovate or are simply trying to meet regulation quotas for electric vehicle production. Tesla is a risky, possibly overvalued investment (see <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-earnings-the-moment-of-truth-1477422167">here </a>for example), and other vehicle manufacturers could manufacture a cheaper, long-range, mass-market electric vehicle, subsidized by profits from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). To me, this is unfortunate for Tesla, as without them, technology learning for long-range electric vehicles would probably be at an earlier stage. It is also more cost-reflective and sustainable to not have electric vehicles subsidized by profits from ICEVs. GM have a <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/volt-electric-car.html">2016 hybrid EV Volt</a> for $33,170 US (before the $7,500 US tax credit); and a <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/spark-ev-electric-vehicle.html">2016 Spark hybrid EV</a> for $25,120 (before the $7,500 US tax credit). This is cheaper than <a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_AU/model3">Tesla's Model 3</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/teslas-self-driving-car-plan-seems-insane-just-might-work/">claimed self-driving</a> pure EV, with a much longer pure EV range, which Tesla announced would be $35,000 before tax incentives. However, comparing hybrid EVs with EVs is like comparing apples with oranges. Model 3 undercuts Chevrolet's 2017 pure EV <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/bolt-ev-electric-vehicle.html">Bolt </a>at $37,495 before tax. There are also smaller, shorter range pure EVs such as the <a href="http://www.nissan.com.au/Cars-Vehicles/LEAF/Overview">Nissan Leaf</a> and the <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/ford/focus-electric">Ford Focus Electric</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Model 3 has a range of 345 km / 214 miles, compared to Bolt's 383 /238 miles. Bolt is a hatchback without a boot, Model 3 is a sedan. "Model 3 is faster and features RWD. Bolt is available in late 2016. while Tesla will struggle to meet demand in 2017 and onwards. <a href="http://www.cheatsheet.com/automobiles/tesla-model-3-vs-chevy-bolt-ev-5-key-differences.html/?a=viewall">Read more.</a></p>

<p>Without considering the financial health of Tesla and GM, I would buy a Tesla Model 3 over a GM Bolt. However, the financial health of Tesla is much more questionable than the financial health of GM. Their potential acquisition of Solar City will make them even more debt-laden and capital intensive. The stock is probably overvalued (analyse its debt, revenue, profits, market capitalization, balance sheet, and share capitalization), although it still has very strong growth potential. I'd be weary about investing in Tesla, and would only do so if I was prepared to lose all of my investment, in the event that it went bankrupt. Given that it would be an investment with a strong positive social and environmental impact, I would still be prepared to invest say, up to 5%, of my cash.</p>

<p>Tesla has become relatively unique in the sustainable energy industry recently by announcing Powerwall 2, an AC coupled inverter with built-in batteries; solar shingles; and trying to do a merger with SolarCity. In short, it looks like it is trying to be a vertically integrated one stop shop for energy solutions. This makes it easier for customers, marketing, and obtaining more market share. It may also make it harder to innovate and more prone to disruption from innovation outside the company. For instance, there are better forms of stationary energy storage. While lithium ion batteries have the volume and relatively low price compared to other forms of energy storage, they are prone to bursting into flames (a.k.a thermal runaway) especially if physically damaged, are not able to be deeply cycled to 0% SOC, and will lose capacity over time. Solar shingles may look attractive, but they are more expensive to install, and aren't ventilated, which reduces their efficiency and thus their economic performance.</p>

<p>There are several ways to increase the uptake of EVs. Broadly, these ways are: reduce cost to the end-user, increase the supply (but matching with demand), or increase the appeal of EVs to the end user.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cost reductions include with manufacturing (which is what Tesla is trying to do by designing its Gigagactory using CAD, using vertical integration, and scale), shipping (e.g. economically optimised shipping routes, and crewless automated ships), weight reductions, high pressure thin tyres, electricity, maintenance, insurance, and government subsidies (e.g. tax credits, carbon pricing, and fuel taxes).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Increasing the supply could be done in tandem with reducing shipping costs by having more factories geographically spread out, but this needs to be balanced with demand and other considerations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Increasing the appeal can be done in many ways, such as catering to different markets through a variety of car models, safety (e.g. stronger crumple zones, autonomous driving, making lithium ion batteries safer or using a safer alternative), autonomous driving, aesthetics; human-computer interfaces such as Android Auto (which apparently trumps Apple Carplay, read more here—<a href="http://www.stuff.tv/features/android-auto-vs-apple-carplay">http://www.stuff.tv/features/android-auto-vs-apple-carplay</a>) and auto-opening doors; longer range (Tesla's Model 3 or GM's Chevy Bolt have a range that is 5-6 times the average commute of 40 miles); better performance (e.g. aerodynamics, acceleration, traction, steering and suspension, which are more important than topspeed due to speed limits); energy generation on the car (e.g. windows using Ubiquitous Energy transparent cells, or solar paint developed at the University of Newcastle [technology still under development]); storage space (depends on the target market); and better charging infrastructure (faster, more ubiquitous, and cheaper).</p>

<p>Retrofitting internal combustion engine vehicles to make them into electric vehicles. One example of a business doing this is <a href="http://www.kreiselelectric.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kreisel</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Swapping batteries in electric vehicles. I am not sure whether this would be feasible. Tesla did a trial to gauge demand and found that demand did not seem to be sufficient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Accelerating charging infrastructure for electric vehicles: e.g. <a href="http://www.parkspark.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ParkSpark</a>. Also, another idea is an advocacy group to support better standards, appropriate training (e.g. mechanics to retrofit internal combustion engine vehicles&nbsp;into electric vehicles), and more generally, removing barriers to the uptake of electric vehicles. Also, another idea is a&nbsp;community platform to act as a funding vehicle for EV uptake (e.g. for charging infrastructure), for bulk buying (like <a href="https://suncrowd.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suncrowd</a>) or quote comparisons (similar to <a href="https://www.solarquotes.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SolarQuotes</a>) of electric vehicles. Another idea is to use energy trading coupled with charging stations to help increase the economic benefits of charging stations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another innovation is car sharing, e.g. with <a href="https://www.goget.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoGet</a>. A GoGet representative said at a Climathon/EnergyLab event in Sydney that they provided electric vehicles, but said that there were issues with the vehicle not being fully charged when it was returned, which incurred a fee. If the car was booked immediately afterwards, it was returned. Their website does not list any electric vehicles in its fleet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mobility as a service is another innovation, e.g. <a href="https://www.uber.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uber</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyft</a>.</p>

<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a lot of innovations in the energy industry that can deliver many benefits. It is important that benefits are distributed equitably and not concentrated with a handful of stakeholders. It is important that non-technical and non-cost barriers to development are overcome in order to increase the uptake of renewable energy.</p>
