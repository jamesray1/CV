#### [Crypto developer, researcher and technical writer](crypto-industry-experience.md)

2017-06–2019-06, 2019-10. Sydney (remote). Most of my efforts in reverse chronological order were on work with [Holochain](https://holochain.org), [gossipsub](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/767), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) [2.0](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs) [development](https://github.com/Drops-of-Diamond/diamond_drops), research and technical writing, as well as a couple of other projects with [Pocket Network](https://pokt.network/), [Katallassos](https://katallassos.com), and [Substrate](https://www.parity.io/substrate/), and Locale. I am more enthused about Holochain, [Ceptr](http://ceptr.org/), and the [Metacurrency Project](http://metacurrency.org/) than I am about blockchains.

Programming languages: mostly used [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but also studied and/or used [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/), Javascript, Go, Python, and C++.
