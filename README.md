## Incentivizing Waste Reduction
Founder, Feb 2019 to March 2019

This was a brief period looking into weight-based pricing for waste. For more information (FMI), see [https://iwr-wasteless.github.io/iwr/](https://iwr-wasteless.github.io/iwr/). "Use a scale built into a garbage truck to measure the net weight of residual and organic waste bins, and charge the bin's rate payer on a per kg basis for this waste (e.g. 60 c/kg AUD and 20 c/kg, respectively), with 9 recyclable collection streams collected in bags monthly or bimonthly; and some other improvements like cleaning up dumped waste; optional electronic locks for bins; and locked gate systems for apartments; as demonstrated successfully in Sweden, Germany and Denmark".

## Crypto sector experience

Due to insufficient funding for gossipsub and Eth 2 development, after working on these projects and contributing in the Ethereum sector part-time then full time since June 2017 and Feb 2018, respectively, trying unsuccessfully to get a suitable job or grants, I'm looking for a job. I'm focusing on getting a job in the renewable energy industry, as this
is where I have the most experience, and the industry has a lot of potential, and is also apparently growing again as of recently in 2019. I worked in this sector because I saw that it had a lot of potential to empower individuals and organizations through the decentralized web and finance. However, it seems that there aren't as many jobs in this sector compared to the renewable industry.

While working in the renewable energy industry my interests included the following, but I am not involved in the industry and have focused on the above:

<ul><li>innovation in the sustainable energy industry, reducing costs and increasing supply, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>enabling energy technologies for intermittent renewable energy generation, such as energy storage (e.g. adiabatic compressed air and flow batteries), smarter and more interconnected grids, and demand side management;</li>
 	<li>sustainable energy generation;</li>
 	<li>peripheral energy technologies such as monitoring, trading, transportation, energy efficiency, and finance;</li>
 	<li>useful applications of energy.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>

Services and skills included:

<ul><li>data analysis, e.g. Excel or r;</li><li>sustainable energy research and advocacy;</li><li>technical support;</li><li>solar system design &amp; fault finding;</li><li>energy efficiency consulting;</li><li>CAD;</li><li>MATLAB;</li><li>electricity markets planning and economics, policy analysis, and operation and control;</li><li>project management; and</li><li>sustainability design, simulation, and analysis in the built environment.</li></ul>

### Technical Support Engineer / Customer Service Representative at Sungrow

March 2016—February 2018

See <a href="https://github.com/jamesray1/work-log/blob/master/Sungrow-log.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>&nbsp;for tasks completed, and <a href="https://sustergy.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/finishing-position-at-sungrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for the reason for leaving.

### Solar Engineer at Solar Energy Enterprises

Two days a week from 12 July 2017—29 August 2017 with Solar Energy Enterprises and Clean Energy Corporation doing residential and solar solar project management, which so far (as of 30 July 2017) includes roof feasibility studies for solar installation and grid applications. I finished the work by my choice because I want to focus more time on Ethereum, and could be working full-time at Sungrow if I wanted to (which I don't at the moment), but offered to post an ad on a Facebook page for my former school network to find a replacement.

### Independent researcher on the sustainable energy industry

2011–2016 (this includes a Bachelor of Engineering in Renewable energy from 2011–14).

A summary of my findings can be found <a href="https://sustergy.co/sustainable-energy-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Researching sustainable&nbsp;innovation from the idea stage of the technology life cycle through to commercial maturity. I do this to find areas that I would be most interested in contributing my time, energy and money to in order to maximise&nbsp;positive impact.

### Founding Principal Tutor at TuWorks

July 2012–2016

Tutoring students from preschool to master's level in renewable energy engineering at UNSW. Tutored several university students. Subjects that I have taught include: academic writing, renewable energy engineering courses such as Wind Energy Converters and Electricity Industry Operation and Control; Excel, chemistry, physics, maths, English. Read more <a href="https://tuworks.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

### Project/Engineering Assistant at Todae Solar

I worked in a project team to assess the suitability and potential for solar at 296 sites in WA, Queensland and Victoria, using nearmap and Excel. I completed the project ahead of schedule with 1000 sites assessed by three project assistants (with minimal supervision from managers) in three weeks. There were two stages to each site assessment. The first stage was assessing whether the site was suitable for solar. This included screening criteria such as enough usable area for 5 kW of panels, after considering estimating the percentage of roof elements and shading. If the site passed the screening, we would proceed to draw the area where solar would be usable, then enter the area to calculate the size of the solar system. I took the initiative to use pivot tables and filters for quality control, and corrected any errors found, resulting in a high degree of confidence in the data. I also got quotations from UAV photography providers for marketing purposes using existing solar sites in Perth. The position was a temporary full time basis to get the project done from Wednesday 11th of November to the 27th of November, while the other two assistants started on Monday the 9th.

I was pleased to be told by Nikhil Dhyan, the Project Manager, that he was happy with my work. Later, when I asked if he could be a referee for a job that I applied for, he asked to find out more about the role so that he could "sell me as much as possible". The General Manager, Tirone Kahn, said that if I am "an applicable candidate for future work we will surely contact you".

The recommendation is available on my <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/jameschristopherray" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn profile</a>.

### Product Development Manager at&nbsp;Solar Energy Enterprises

Worked about 4 hours a week for several weeks in mid-2015 as a product development manager, researching additional products to sell such as solar monitoring, hybrid inverters, and energy efficiency and energy monitoring devices. Solar Energy Enterprises is a solar sales organisation focusing mostly on residential systems. I approached them to suggest that they could add some products to their line, researched them, and made a proposal which included explaining how the products work, and benefits for sales staff and for customers. They ended up adding a hybrid inverter, a solar monitoring product, and an energy monitoring and control product to their product suite.

I also providing sales assistance and technical support at an expo and as a door-to-door lead generator doorknocker in late 2014 / early 2015.

### Operations/Engineering Assistant at&nbsp;Solar Analytics

I worked in a full-time position from the 23rd of February 2015 to the 13th of March 2015. Achievements include:
- monitored data using a propriety software platform;
- used Zendesk to monitor, assess, and comment on support tickets;
- developed a training guide for solar installers on how to install and configure the SC-22 hardware used with the monitoring product;
- packaged and posted SC-22 devices to clients; and
- researched procurement of parts to assemble an outdoor rated adaptor box for the SC-22 device.

### Village Infrastructure

I was a consultant&nbsp;pitching for funds for a contest for solar agroprocessing in developing countries. This was more of a project that took about a few days work in around late 2015.

## Education

Bachelor of Engineering (Renewable Energy) at the University of New South Wales, 2011–2014. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/JMesqzjt4AcnW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a link to my academic transcript</a>, although it isn't particularly impressive.
