<p>I'm actively looking for any job; and public support, a trial with a council, resources and funding for <a href="https://iwr-wasteless.github.io/iwr/">this proposal</a> to reduce waste, with similar schemes that have already been successfully implemented in Sweden,  Germany and Denmark. Use a scale built into a garbage truck to measure the net weight of residual and organic waste bins, and charge the bin's rate payer on a per kg basis for this waste (e.g. 60 c/kg AUD and 20 c/kg, respectively), with 9 recyclable collection streams collected in bags monthly or bimonthly; and some other improvements like cleaning up dumped waste; optional electronic locks for bins; and locked gate systems for apartments; as demonstrated successfully in Sweden, Germany and Denmark. Sign <a href="http:// https://secure.avaaz.org/en/community_petitions/Local_councils_Incentivize_waste_reduction_by_weighing_general_waste_and_charging_for_the_weight/">this petition</a>. My background in reverse chronological order is with decentralized messaging protocol development (<a href="https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/767">gossipsub</a>), Eth 2 development (to a deprecated spec using a sharding manager contract) with <a href="https://github.com/Drops-of-Diamond/Diamond-drops">Drops of Diamond</a>, contributing to Ethereum research and docs, working in the renewable energy industry, studying a bachelor of renewable energy engineering, and various other "training ground" roles.</p>

<h2>Solar Engineer at Solar Energy Enterprises</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>Two days a week from 12 July 2017—29 August 2017 with Solar Energy Enterprises and Clean Energy Corporation doing residential and solar solar project management, which so far (as of 30 July 2017) includes roof feasibility studies for solar installation and grid applications. I finished the work by my choice because I want to focus more time on Ethereum, and could be working full-time at Sungrow if I wanted to (which I don't at the moment), but offered to post an ad on a Facebook page for my former school network to find a replacement.</p>

<h2>Project/Engineering Assistant at Todae Solar</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I worked in a project team to assess the suitability and potential for solar at 296 sites in WA, Queensland and Victoria, using nearmap and Excel. I completed the project ahead of schedule with 1000 sites assessed by three project assistants (with minimal supervision from managers) in three weeks. There were two stages to each site assessment. The first stage was assessing whether the site was suitable for solar. This included screening criteria such as enough usable area for 5 kW of panels, after considering estimating the percentage of roof elements and shading. If the site passed the screening, we would proceed to draw the area where solar would be usable, then enter the area to calculate the size of the solar system. I took the initiative to use pivot tables and filters for quality control, and corrected any errors found, resulting in a high degree of confidence in the data. I also got quotations from UAV photography providers for marketing purposes using existing solar sites in Perth. The position was a temporary full time basis to get the project done from Wednesday 11th of November to the 27th of November, while the other two assistants started on Monday the 9th.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was pleased to be told by Nikhil Dhyan, the Project Manager, that he was happy with my work. Later, when I asked if he could be a referee for a job that I applied for, he asked to find out more about the role so that he could "sell me as much as possible". The General Manager, Tirone Kahn, said that if I am "an applicable candidate for future work we will surely contact you".</p>

<h2>Product Development Manager at&nbsp;Solar Energy Enterprises</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Worked about 4 hours a week for several weeks in mid-2015 as a product development manager, researching additional products to sell such as solar monitoring, hybrid inverters, and energy efficiency and energy monitoring devices. Solar Energy Enterprises is a solar sales organisation focusing mostly on residential systems. I approached them to suggest that they could add some products to their line, researched them, and made a proposal which included explaining how the products work, and benefits for sales staff and for customers. They ended up adding a hybrid inverter, a solar monitoring product, and an energy monitoring and control product to their product suite.</p>
