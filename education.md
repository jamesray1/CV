### Bachelor of Renewable Energy Engineering (Honours)

[Here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaSve25zBPgmxX7A91cWxtPPcRG3bpLJeFBFXKj3F1Zv8) is a link to my academic transcript and graduate statement at UNSW for a Bachelor of Renewable Energy Engineering (Honours). Solar system design, installation, analysis, PVSyst, line diagrams, tender submission; wind energy converters, feasibility studies; energy efficiency, environmmentally sustainable design (ESD); spreadsheets; thermodynamics, fluid mechanics; life cycle assessment; etc.

<!--#### Honours thesis-->

<!--My [Honours thesis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RpCaakU2lSBgtsK4DFPihAb6BHMJTt6G) for my Bachelor of Renewable Energy Engineering degree was a technical, economic, and policy analysis of sustainable energy measures for homes. [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DjHEVMzMa0_1i926MrLNj-nHuBcXVGn0) is my economic analysis.

<!--The thesis needs a lot of improvement in terms of structure and presentation. I had limited time to do so during semester. I may continue to make further improvements where I can spare the time. While it was interesting and challenging choosing my own thesis topic, I should've been more strategic and organized about what I spent time on—spending less time on the literature review (particularly reading) and more time on writing and finalizing the paper. More time could have been spent on experimentation—e.g. doing surveys for behavioural analysis, although that would've added complications with going through an ethics screening, and was not encouraged by my supervisor, and probably would've made the thesis too large in scope, with it being large enough as it was!

<!--All are welcome to give feedback. Don't be daunted by the length of the thesis! A lot of it is tables, diagrams and appendices. The abstract is always the best place to start, it is like a mini-thesis and is meant to be able to stand on its own independently of the rest of the thesis. If you are still interested after reading that you can move on to the introduction, results and conclusions. The literature review may also be helpful to read, particularly the two reports from IEA-RETD; and DBCCA and Rockefeller.
