#### Honours thesis

My Bachelor of Renewable Energy Engineering [Honours thesis](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNLf9jUJNVqeZm4bjzzeWu4WziALk5zf2UWQXL2mPp4Bi) was a technical, economic, and policy analysis of sustainable energy measures for homes. Here is my economic analysis.

I admit that it could be improved. All are welcome to give feedback. Don't be daunted by the length of the thesis! A lot of it is tables, diagrams and appendices. The abstract is always the best place to start, it is like a mini-thesis and is meant to be able to stand on its own independently of the rest of the thesis. If you are still interested after reading that you can move on to the introduction, results and conclusions. The literature review may also be helpful to read, particularly the two reports from IEA-RETD; and DBCCA and Rockefeller.
