My achievements and key responsibilities as a Technical Support Engineer at [Sungrow](https://en.sungrowpower.com/) include:

* liaising with electrical contractors to organise on-site service;
* managing logistics, warehouse and inventory control;
* training technical support engineers;

Projects included:
* investigating requirements from AEMO, TNSPs & DNSPs for utility scale inverters and liaising between staff and these exernal paries to refine a model of a utility scale inverter to meet these requirements.
* suggesting the development of [a website for Australia](https://www.sungrowpower.com.au/), overseeing its development by another colleague on Zoho sites, and improving it myself, including design, editing, experimenting with a bot and expanding the knowledge base;
* providing feedback for existing products and services and for potential growth areas with new product development, such as improvements to the LCD, automatic settings adjustment for certain faults and CT clamp design.
* improving efficiency: for emails with Zoho Desk; spreadsheets; and procuring headsets instead of using a handset for the phones;
* recording voiceovers for videos and assisting with their creation;
* presenting at an Australian Solar Council installer training event in South Australia to promote our solar hybrid inverter and battery system, the PowCube 4.8, consisting of the SH5K inverter and the SBP4K8 battery;
* creating Twitter accounts for a global account, [@SungrowPowerSCo](https://twitter.com/sungrowpowersco), and an Australian account, [@SungrowPowerAU](https://twitter.com/SungrowPowerAU)
* creating and managing a survey for customers who had their inverter replaced, collecting responses via email and phone, analysing results, and following up on feedback for improvement;

The position was terminated in Feb 2018 because my manager wanted me to work full-time, whereas I wanted to continue working in the crypto sector. However, and as detailed [here](crypto-industry-experience.md#reason-for-ending-gossipsub-and-ethereum-20-development), I haven't been able to get funding for my work in the crypto sector, so I started looking for a job from Feb 2019.
