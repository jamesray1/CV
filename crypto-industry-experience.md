### Further independent study and work
Feb 2019–present

I've studied [Holochain](https://holochain.org/), [Tender](https://www.tender.buzz/), [Katallassos](https://katallassos.com/), and other projects. I'm most interested in Holochain, and think it has more potential than blockchains. Tender also looks very promising, allowing for zero-fee transactions, while providing and using the unlimited scalability of Holochain. Nevertheless, blockchains do improve on the status quo of more centralized, traditional finance. I just think the energy spent on researching and building blockchains would seem more worthwhile being directed to Holochain, or a similar platform, since everything that you can do on a blockchain can be done with Holochain.

The following are some ways you can see my contributions to the Holochain ecosystem (in addition to the multitude of information you can find via https://holochain.org/) with my [Github activity](https://github.com/jamesray1), plus more community and marketing oriented contributions as follows:
- on Medium, e.g. Holochain [pros and cons](https://medium.com/@james.ray/holochain-pros-and-cons-569973763a38?source=---------3------------------) and [Holochain economics](https://medium.com/@james.ray/holochain-economics-671ef4a66974)
- in the Mattermost chat server at [chat.holochain.org/](https://chat.holochain.org/)

### <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/767">Gossipsub</a> development

~Jun 2018–Feb 2019.

A scalable, efficient, extensible baseline pubsub (publish-subscribe, messaging) protocol for p2p networks and decentralized applications on top of them. See <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/767">here</a> for details. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fv8XqLkMjdBkGPkVWfJulJU-5Qv6TSUR4oD5uKSEHW0/edit#gid=58883616">Timesheet (includes Drops of Diamond)</a>.

#### Reason for ending Gossipsub and Ethereum 2.0 development

Due to insufficient funding for gossipsub and Eth 2 development, after working on these projects for over a year, and contributing in the Ethereum sector part-time then full time since June 2017 and Feb 2018, respectively, trying unsuccessfully to get a grant or job with Ethereum after much effort, I'm looking for a job. I'm focusing on getting a job in the renewable energy industry, as this
is where I have the most experience. There also aren't as many jobs in the crypto sector compared to the renewable industry. I worked in the crypto sector because I saw that it had a lot of potential to empower individuals and organizations through the decentralized web and finance, and still does.
