I first got involved with the
crypto industry when I started
looking into peer-to-peer
electricity trading with
blockchains in 2017. I saw that Ethereum, a blockchain that is
a distributed app platform, wasn't scalable, so I decided to
contribute towards making it more scalable. In February 2019,
after around two years of involvement with Ethereum, and not
being able to get enough funding to sustainably support work 
(only some advisory work and a couple of donations from 
community members, and no grants from the Ethereum Foundation 
for the bulk of my efforts), I started applying for jobs, and 
found out about Holochain via a Rust developer job ad. 
More information about the Holochain ecosystem is available via [holochain.org](https://holochain.org), [holo.host](https://holo.host), [this excellent video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3X5_zAUjlw), and [the MetaCurrency Project](http://metacurrency.org/).

While I
didn't get that job, I've still been contributing. I am still 
enthusiastic about renewable energy, but I think it's having a
hard time scaling quickly enough to be able to phase out all 
fossil fuel energy. The industrial-company-capitalist approach 
has resulted in impressive growth, but again, the growth rate 
isn't fast enough. My hope is that a distributed Web and 
economy, powered by a secure and scalable platform such as 
Holochain, may help to enable a transition to a fairer world.

### Further independent work and study
Feb 2019–present

General tasks involved include doing some contractual work with a few projects, applying for jobs, and study and contributing voluntarily to Holochain. I've studied [Holochain](https://holochain.org/), [Tender](https://www.tender.buzz/), [Katallassos](https://katallassos.com/), and other projects. I'm most interested in Holochain, as it can provide scalable distribute apps with data integrity, in order to build a decentralized Web and economy, with [democratic power relationships](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/holochain-the-perfect-framework-for-decentralised-cooperation-at-scale/2018/06/26?cn-reloaded=1&cn-reloaded=1). It has a design inspired by nature. It combines the best of decentralized technology, such as DHTs, dual pair key cryptography and signatures, hashing, and git.

Support me via [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/106/holochain-core-development), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/jamesray1) to develop Holochain.

The following are some ways you can see my contributions to the Holochain ecosystem with my [Github activity](https://github.com/jamesray1), plus more community and marketing oriented contributions as follows:
- on Medium, e.g. Holochain [pros and cons](https://medium.com/@james.ray/holochain-pros-and-cons-569973763a38?source=---------3------------------) and [Holochain economics](https://medium.com/@james.ray/holochain-economics-671ef4a66974).
- in the Mattermost chat server at [chat.holochain.org/](https://chat.holochain.org/)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/jamescray1/) (in r/holochain)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JamesChrRay)

I think Holochain has more potential than blockchains. Blockchains try to improve on the status quo of more centralized, traditional finance, but they haven't succeeded in scaling yet. I think the energy spent on researching and building blockchains would seem more worthwhile being directed to Holochain, or a similar platform, since everything that you can do on a blockchain can be done with Holochain.

### Locale advisor

Contributed in a design sprint for 5 days as an advisor and worked with the team to build a prototype.

Locale is looking to build an inventory management system on Holochain.

### <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/767">Gossipsub</a> development

~Jun 2018–Feb 2019.

A scalable, efficient, extensible baseline pubsub (publish-subscribe, messaging) protocol for p2p networks and decentralized applications on top of them. See <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/767">here</a> for details. <!--<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fv8XqLkMjdBkGPkVWfJulJU-5Qv6TSUR4oD5uKSEHW0/edit#gid=58883616">Timesheet (includes Drops of Diamond)</a>.-->

#### Reason for ending Gossipsub and Ethereum 2.0 development

Due to insufficient funding for gossipsub and Eth 2 development, after working on these projects for over a year, and contributing in the Ethereum sector part-time then full time since June 2017 and Feb 2018, respectively, trying unsuccessfully to get a grant or job with Ethereum after much effort, I'm looking for a job. I worked in the crypto sector because I saw that it had a lot of potential to empower individuals and organizations through the decentralized web and finance, and still does, but with more potential with Holochain.
