Due to insufficient funding for gossipsub and Eth 2 development, after working on these projects for over a year, and contributing in the Ethereum sector part-time then full time since June 2017 and Feb 2018, respectively, trying unsuccessfully to get a grant or job with Ethereum after much effort, I'm looking for a job. I'm focusing on getting a job in the renewable energy industry, as this
is where I have the most experience. There also aren't as many jobs in the crypto sector compared to the renewable industry. I worked in the crypto sector because I saw that it had a lot of potential to empower individuals and organizations through the decentralized web and finance, and still does.

### Other independent study and work
Feb 2019–present

I've studied [Holochain](https://holochain.org/), [Tender](https://www.tender.buzz/), [Katallassos](https://katallassos.com/), and other projects. I'm most interested in Holochain, and think it has more potential than blockchains. Tender also looks very promising, allowing for zero-fee transactions, while providing and using the unlimited scalability of Holochain. Nevertheless, blockchains do improve on the status quo of more centralized, traditional finance. I just think the energy spent on researching and building blockchains would seem more worthwhile being directed to Holochain, or a similar platform.

Holochain pros:

- unlimited scalability
- doesn't enforce universal consensus when every use case can do without it. Mutual and reputational credit can be used for transactions rather than fiat cryptocurrencies or tokens. You should be able to implement a blockchain as a Holochain happ, but again, this isn't necessary. Fiat currencies (including cryptocurrencies) have inherent centralization with the stakeholders controlling the currency, e.g. developers, miners, stakers, validators; although this could be mitigated with a DAO, but then governance of the DAO can be complicated and there hasn't been a secure demonstration yet.
- You can build a full (stack) happ on Holochain, rather than just a smart contract. This allows all of the code, state and data for the happ to be decentralized, rather than only hosting some code e.g. on GitHub servers, plus the developers, testers, and early-adopters who host it on their local machines. If there is a fork in a node in one line of code, that node gets rejected by validators and must fork to its own happ to continue operating independently, or sync with the existing happ.

Cons:

- rather than using consensus, mutual and reputational credit hinges on KYC. But perhaps this isn't such a bad thing, and you could potentially have a web-of-trust like mechanism (a la [KILT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrflSdCOLvE&list=PLp0_ueXY_enWqrfP_vR4PLhzQj76fLT8y)) to decentralise the KYC and trust. More details are below, or above. Additionally, if you don't need to transact currencies, and just transfer data, then Holochain, Secure Scuttlebutt, and Dat Protocol are more suitable than blockchains, with the above advantages. Not enforcing universal consensus is what enables unlimited scalability.
