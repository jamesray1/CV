### Further independent study and work
Feb 2019–present

I've studied [Holochain](https://holochain.org/), [Tender](https://www.tender.buzz/), [Katallassos](https://katallassos.com/), and other projects. I'm most interested in Holochain, as it can provide scalable distribute apps with data integrity. It has a design inspired by nature. It combines the best of decentralized technology, such as DHTs, dual pair key cryptography and signatures, hashing, and git.

The following are some ways you can see my contributions to the Holochain ecosystem (in addition to information you can find via https://holochain.org/ and https://holo.host/) with my [Github activity](https://github.com/jamesray1), plus more community and marketing oriented contributions as follows:
- on Medium, e.g. Holochain [pros and cons](https://medium.com/@james.ray/holochain-pros-and-cons-569973763a38?source=---------3------------------) and [Holochain economics](https://medium.com/@james.ray/holochain-economics-671ef4a66974)
- in the Mattermost chat server at [chat.holochain.org/](https://chat.holochain.org/)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/jamescray1/) (in r/holochain)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JamesChrRay)

I think Holochain has more potential than blockchains. Blockchains try to improve on the status quo of more centralized, traditional finance, but they haven't succeeded in scaling yet. I think the energy spent on researching and building blockchains would seem more worthwhile being directed to Holochain, or a similar platform, since everything that you can do on a blockchain can be done with Holochain.

~Jun 2018–Feb 2019.

A scalable, efficient, extensible baseline pubsub (publish-subscribe, messaging) protocol for p2p networks and decentralized applications on top of them. See <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/767">here</a> for details. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fv8XqLkMjdBkGPkVWfJulJU-5Qv6TSUR4oD5uKSEHW0/edit#gid=58883616">Timesheet (includes Drops of Diamond)</a>.

#### Reason for ending Gossipsub and Ethereum 2.0 development

Due to insufficient funding for gossipsub and Eth 2 development, after working on these projects for over a year, and contributing in the Ethereum sector part-time then full time since June 2017 and Feb 2018, respectively, trying unsuccessfully to get a grant or job with Ethereum after much effort, I'm looking for a job. I worked in the crypto sector because I saw that it had a lot of potential to empower individuals and organizations through the decentralized web and finance, and still does, but with more potential with Holochain.
